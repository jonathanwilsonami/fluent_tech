"""
Def: Assertions in Python are statements that allow you to test assumptions made by your program. An assertion is a sanity check that you can turn on 
or turn off when youâ€™re done with your testing of the program.
Usage: assert condition, message

__debug__ is a built-in constant in Python that is True by default. It is used to check if the interpreter is running in optimized mode. 
If Python is started with the -O (optimize) flag, __debug__ is set to False.

The __debug__ constant is often used in conjunction with assertions or other debugging and testing code to ensure that certain checks are only performed when the interpreter is not optimized.

Purpose:
- to check invariants that should always be true else it would be a bug
- commonly used in testing. 

Note:
- Assertions are not run when python is run in optimized mode. 
- Assertions are for debugging: They should not be used for handling runtime errors that could occur due to user input or other external factors.
- Assertions can be disabled: When Python is run with the -O (optimize) switch, all assertions are removed from the bytecode. 
  Therefore, assertions should not be used to perform essential operations in your code.
