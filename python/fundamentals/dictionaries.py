How can you merge two dictionaries such that the values of overlapping keys are combined into a list?
How can you merge two dictionaries and sum the values of overlapping keys?
Write a function to merge multiple dictionaries where the values of overlapping keys are concatenated strings.
How do you merge dictionaries stored in a list and handle overlapping keys by storing values in a set to avoid duplicates?
How can you merge dictionaries and create a new dictionary where the keys are the same and the values are lists of all values associated with those keys in the original dictionaries?
How would you merge two dictionaries by recursively merging nested dictionaries and summing the values of overlapping keys?
Write a function that merges a list of dictionaries where the keys are the same, and the values are combined into a list of unique values.
How can you merge dictionaries with keys representing dates and aggregate their values, assuming the values are numerical?
Write a function to merge dictionaries where the values are sets of elements, ensuring the merged dictionary has combined sets without duplicates.
