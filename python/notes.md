# General Python Notes
- __Locale__ -  Refers to the set of cultural and linguistic conventions used by a computer program to format and display data such as dates, times, numbers, and currency in a way
that is familiar to users from a particular region or language.

```python
import locale

# Set locale to US English
locale.setlocale(locale.LC_ALL, 'en_US.UTF-8')

# Format a number according to the current locale
number = 1234567.89
formatted_number = locale.format_string("%d", number, grouping=True)
print(formatted_number)  # Output: '1,234,567'

# Set locale to German
locale.setlocale(locale.LC_ALL, 'de_DE.UTF-8')
```
